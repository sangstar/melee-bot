# Melee Bot: Fine-tuning Llama 2 using Self-Instruct to give tips for winning in Super Smash Bros Melee

This is a small project I've worked on to use LoRa to fine-tune a Llama 2 model to give Smash Bros Melee advice. It was trained off of guides from different sources, but mostly from Smashboards, the most popular Super Smash Bros forum. 

I've written an [article](https://sangstar.github.io/nlp/2023/08/15/melee_bot.html) for this on my website which details how I got my data, how I used it to seed for new data, how I cleaned the data, and how I trained my model.
